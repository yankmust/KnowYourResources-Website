            <h1>What is Water</h1>
            <p>Water is a vital and transparent liquid that covers a significant portion of Earth's surface. It is
                composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, forming a chemical compound known as H2O. Water is
                essential for all known forms of life, serving as a universal solvent, a medium for chemical reactions,
                and a crucial component of biological processes. It exists in various forms, including liquid, solid
                (ice), and gas (water vapor). Water plays a critical role in regulating Earth's climate, shaping
                landscapes through erosion, and sustaining ecosystems. The bodies of water types are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Oceans: Expansive saltwater bodies that dominate the Earth's surface, encompassing a diverse array
                    of marine life and playing a critical role in regulating global climate and supporting human
                    livelihoods.</li>
                <li>Rivers: Natural watercourses that flow downhill, transporting freshwater from higher elevations to
                    lower elevations, serving as vital sources of water for drinking, agriculture, and sustaining
                    ecosystems along their banks.</li>
                <li>Seas: Partially enclosed saltwater bodies connected to the ocean, varying in size, and often
                    characterized by distinct ecosystems, providing resources for fishing, transportation, and
                    recreational activities.</li>
                <li>Lakes: Inland bodies of water surrounded by land, ranging in size from small ponds to expansive
                    reservoirs, serving as essential sources of freshwater, supporting diverse aquatic life, and
                    providing recreational opportunities for swimming, boating, and fishing.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>Know Your Resources site supports 4 types of bodies of water which they are <a

            <p>"Water consumption" refers to the amount of water used by individuals, communities, industries, and
                agriculture for various purposes such as drinking, cooking, sanitation, irrigation, and manufacturing.
                It encompasses both direct use, such as household water usage, and indirect use, including water
                embedded in the production of goods and services. Efficient and sustainable water consumption practices
                are important for conserving this vital resource and ensuring its availability for present and future
                generations.
